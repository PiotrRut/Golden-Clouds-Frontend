The webpage is written using React and Node, and cannot be ran without installing additional packages and modules.
I shall host this website on Netlify before the presentation on Thursday, and provide you with a link to it by e-mail!

HTML -  for pure HTML see "public/index.html"
Rest of the website is written using JSX, which essentially is a hybrid between JS and HTML.

CSS - "src/styles/App.css" for the CSS file also including media queries

Validation behaviour - see "src/components/SignInForm.js" for validation on form input

Client side JS - all of the React (.js) files inside the ./src folder

Database writes and reads - see "back_end/index.js" for writes and reads to/from the database.
See "back_end/Bookings.js" and "back_end/User.js" for the Mongo schemas.
